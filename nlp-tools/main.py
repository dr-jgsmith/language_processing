text1 = "The Rhine is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graub√ºnden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands. The largest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about 1,230 km (760 mi), with an average discharge of about 2,900 m3/s (100,000 cu ft/s)."
text2 = "The five senses are taste, touch, hearing, sight, and smell. The tongue is the organ responsible for receiving information about taste, our skin for touch, our ears for sounds, eyes for sight, and nose for smell. Our senses take in information about the surrounding environment and that information is then transferred to the brain."
text3 = "The  House's Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republicans, had been pushing for language that would eliminate these required services, but House leaders originally said it couldn't be done under the special procedures through which the legislation is being moved through Congress. These require only 51 votes and don't allow for a Democratic filibuster. Wednesday night, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said the Senate parliamentarian had told him the insurance provisions would not necessarily violate those budget procedures."
